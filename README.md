# FizzBuzz in Javascript
My solution to the FizzBuzz kata written in Javscript, test driven using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).

## The rules
Print the numbers from 1 to 100
If a number is divisible by 3 print "Fizz" instead
If a number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz" instead
If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz" instead
